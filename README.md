This is a module (and example on how to use) about group thoery, and group generators.
Currently, it can produce (using the famous Todd-Coxter algorithm) all the elements
for a group given its generators. It currently only supports non-inverse elements (so
using standard notation, only capital lettered independant elements) so identity
combinations must be converted using the elements order.
coming features:
	- element multiplication table
	- element equivalence calculation
todo list:
	- proper doctesting
changelog:
	1.0:
		first working prototype
